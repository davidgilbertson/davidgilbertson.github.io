#TPYO
Go to the [demo page](http://davidgilbertson.github.io/) to see Tpyo in action.
Tpyo is a way for the readers of your site report typos and suggest corrections.

##Why?
Because typos make you look bad. Mistakes in instructions frustrate your users. Because my favourite beef bourgignon recipe calls for 12kg of potatoes and that's been bugging me for years, but how do I report it?

##What?
What exactly does it let your visitors do? Well, when they select a piece of text on a page, an unobtrusive little tag will show up at the bottom of the screen asking if they would like to report a typo. Clicking this brings up the Tpyo box, where they will see the text they have selected, be able to enter in a message such as a suggested correction, and hit submit to report the typo.

##How?
It is a little-bit-of-JavaScript that you include in your site. It will start itself up and listen for a few mouse events. It's tiny and fast so don't worry about performance.
You'll also need to handle the corrections on the server, there's a few examples below.
